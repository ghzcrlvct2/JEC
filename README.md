# JEC

This project is an x86 and x86_64 assembler. The assembler is for the JEC compiler. It is designed in a way like a library so it can be used like a api to a assembler,
but really the library is the assembler.

### Example
A good example file is [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghzcrlvct2/JEC/main/CAsmTest.C)

### Supported Compilers
We are trying to make our code portable. If we can make it run on many different systems and compile with many different compiler, it will be better.
so the currently supported compilers are
  - gcc
  - msvc
